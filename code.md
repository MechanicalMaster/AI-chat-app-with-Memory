# Channel Finance Assistant Codebase Documentation

## Overview
The Channel Finance Assistant is a web-based chatbot application built with FastAPI and LangChain that helps users with loan and finance-related questions. The application features a modern UI with dark/light theme support, conversation memory, and input/output filtering.

## Project Structure

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Dependencies**: 
  - LangChain for LLM integration
  - OpenAI for the chat model
  - Jinja2 for templating
  - Pydantic for settings management

## Core Components

### 1. Backend Architecture

#### Main Application (`app/main.py`)
- FastAPI application setup with CORS middleware
- Static file serving configuration
- Health check endpoint
- Root route serving the main chat interface
- API routes integration

#### Chat Service (`app/services/chat_service.py`)
- Implements the core chat functionality using LangChain and OpenAI
- Features:
  - Input/output filtering
  - Memory management
  - Error handling
  - Session management
  - Response generation using ChatOpenAI
  - Topic relevance checking (currently disabled)

### 2. Frontend Implementation
